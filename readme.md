I originally published this as a [prototype in a blog post](http://staxmanade.com/2015/10/integrate-winjs-navigation-with-the-browser-s-history/) but got tired of iterating on it in a blog post so threw it up in this github repo for proper source tracking :)

# What it does

The `WinJS.Navigation` is designed not to depend on the browser history but this makes it difficult to deal with when you want the browser history (address bar) to be in sync with WinJS.Navigation.

# Examples:
